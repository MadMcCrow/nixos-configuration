# My [NIXOS](https://nixos.org/) configuration(s) :

This repo contains the necessary Nix modules for my Nixos systems. I do not recommend you use this as a base for your system, as it's not documented and written to fill my specific needs.

## Flakes :

this uses [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes). to use it call the following `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#`. (your machine must be defined in [flake.nix](file://flake.nix))

## Licence :

this is provided under MIT, because I don't care if you use the same setup.
